# Hello I am a comment and I will be ignored by the computer.
# My purpose is to help humans understand each other's code.

# Here is the simplest program we usually start with:

print("Hello World!")

# From Wikipedia:
# A "Hello, World!" program generally is a computer program that 
# outputs or displays the message "Hello, World!". Such a program 
# is very simple in most programming languages, and is often used 
# to illustrate the basic syntax of a programming language. It is 
# often the first program written by people learning to code. It 
# can also be used as a sanity test to make sure that a computer 
# language is correctly installed, and that the operator 
# understands how to use it.

# CHALLENGE!
